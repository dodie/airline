title: Custom Option Parsers
---

Option parsing is provided to Airline by the instances of the `OptionParser` interface.  Airline ships with a variety of these which implement common option parsing styles which are detailed in the [Parser Overview](index.html).

It is also possible to provide your own custom implementations if you wish to more closely control the option parsing process yourself, here we work through an example implementation.
