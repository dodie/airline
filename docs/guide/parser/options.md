title: Option Parsing
---

Option parsing is provided to Airline by the instances of the `OptionParser` interface.  Airline ships with a variety of these which implement common option parsing styles.  It is also possible to provide your own custom implementations if you wish to more closely control the option parsing process yourself

**TODO Document the OptionParser and implementations thereof**
